# Utility Computing – SOA, Web Services, QoS & SLA
---

## 1. What Is a Service?

A **service** is a piece of functionality that can be used by other systems over a network.

### Key Points
- A service is what you connect together using **Web Services**
- A service is the **endpoint** of a connection
- Each service performs a **specific task**

### Functionalities of a Service
A good service should be:

- **Well-defined**  
  → It clearly describes what it does
- **Self-contained**  
  → It can work independently
- **Independent of other services**  
  → It does not depend on the state or context of other services

 **Example:**  
A weather service that takes a city name and returns temperature.

---

## 2. What Is a Web Service?

A **web service** is a service that is available over the internet and can be accessed by other applications.

### Definition
- Web services are **self-describing**
- They are **stateless** (do not remember previous requests)
- They perform **small, discrete units of work**
- They are accessible over a **network**

### Web Service Providers
- Providers offer **APIs**
- Developers use these APIs to access functionality
- No need to install full applications

 **Example:**  
Google Maps API, Payment Gateway API, Weather API

---

## 3. Web Services Description Language (WSDL)

**WSDL** describes how to use a web service.

### Key Features
- Written in **XML**
- Defines:
  - Data types
  - Messages
  - Communication rules

### Types of Operations

1. **One-way**  
   - Message is sent
   - No response required

2. **Request and Response**  
   - Request is sent
   - Response is received

3. **Solicit Response**  
   - Service requests a response from the client

4. **Notification**  
   - Message sent to multiple receivers

---

## 4. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)

### Definition
**Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)** is a system design where multiple services communicate with each other.

### Characteristics
- Collection of independent services
- Services communicate over a network
- Loosely coupled architecture
- Services can be reused across different systems

### Purpose of SOA
- Flexibility
- Easy integration
- Reusability
- Scalability

 **Example:**  
An online shopping system:
- Login service
- Payment service
- Order service
- Delivery service

### Implementation
- Usually implemented using the **Web Service model**

---

## 5. Quality of Service (QoS)

### Original Definition
Quality of Service (QoS) refers to technologies used to manage network traffic efficiently to improve user experience.

### Modern Usage
QoS is now a broader term used for:
- Customer care evaluations
- Technological evaluations

---

## 6. QoS in Customer Care Evaluations

- Focuses on **customer experience**
- Measured by issues that negatively affect users
- Only problems affecting service quality are evaluated

### Examples

---

## 8. Service Level Agreement (SLA)

### Definition
A **Service Level Agreement (SLA)** is a formal contract between a service provider and a customer.

- Defines services in **measurable terms**
- Uses **QoS metrics**

### Common Contents of an SLA

#### Performance Metrics
- Up-time and down-time ratio
- System throughput
- Response time

#### Problem Management

# Properties and  Characteristics : 

## * Scalability & Elasticity in Cloud Computing

---

## 1. Scalability

### What is Scalability?

**Scalability** is a desirable property of a system, network, or process that shows its ability to:

- Handle **growing amounts of work** smoothly  
- Be **expanded or enlarged easily** when required  
- Maintain performance as demand increases  

In simple words, scalability means:
> *“Can the system grow when more users or workload come?”*

 **Example:**  
A website that works fine for 100 users and can also handle 10,000 users by adding more resources.

---

## 2. Elasticity

### What is Elasticity?

**Elasticity** refers to the ability of a system to:

- **Increase resources when demand increases**
- **Reduce resources when demand decreases**
- Automatically return to its original state after scaling

The term comes from physics:
> *An elastic body returns to its original shape after being stretched or compressed.*

 **Example:**  
Cloud servers automatically increase during peak traffic and decrease at night.

---

## 3. How to Achieve Scalability & Elasticity?

Scalability and elasticity are mainly achieved through:

- **Dynamic Provisioning**
- **Multi-tenant Design**

---

## 4. Dynamic Provisioning

### What is Dynamic Provisioning?

**Dynamic Provisioning** is a method where computing resources (servers, storage, networks) are:

- Automatically **provisioned (added)**
- Automatically **de-provisioned (removed)**
- Controlled through an **administrative console or client application**

These actions can be performed by:
- Server administrator
- Network administrator
- Any authorized user

 In short:
> Resources are allocated **on demand**, not in advance.

---

### Problems in Traditional Computing Model

In traditional systems, two major problems exist:

#### 1. Underestimation of System Utilization
- Results in **under-provisioning**
- System becomes slow or unavailable during high demand
- Lost users and revenue

#### 2. Overestimation of System Utilization
- Results in **over-provisioning**
- Resources remain unused
- Leads to **low utilization and high cost**

---

### Why Cloud Resources Should Be Provisioned Dynamically?

Cloud computing uses dynamic provisioning to handle:

- **Seasonal demand variations**  
    Example: Online shopping during sales

- **Demand variations between different industries**  
    Example: Education vs finance workloads

- **Burst demand during extraordinary events**  
    Example: Live streaming of major events, exams, or launches

---

## 5. Multi-tenant Design

### What is Multi-tenant Design?

**Multi-tenant design** is a software architecture principle where:

- It **serves multiple client organizations (tenants)**
- Each tenant shares the same infrastructure

---

### How Multi-tenancy Works

- Data and configuration are **virtually partitioned**
- Each client gets:
  - Separate data
  - Custom configuration
- Clients experience it as their **own virtual application**

  **Example:**  
Google Workspace serving multiple companies using the same platform.

---

## 6. Client-Oriented Requirements in Multi-tenant Design

### 1. Customization

- Multi-tenant applications must support a **high level of customization**
- Each organization may need:
  - Different settings
  - Different workflows
  - Different user roles

---

### 2. Quality of Service (QoS)

Multi-tenant applications must ensure:

- **Security**  
  - Data isolation between tenants

- **Robustness**  
  - One tenant’s issue should not affect others

- **Reliable performance**  
  - Fair resource distribution among clients

---

## 7. Summary

- **Scalability** → Ability to grow with increased workload
- **Elasticity** → Ability to scale up and scale down automatically
- **Dynamic Provisioning** → On-demand allocation of resources
- **Multi-tenant Design** → Single software instance serving multiple clients

- The decrease is **proportional to the failure severity**
- Unlike poorly designed systems where a small fault causes total failure

 **Example:**  
If one server fails, another server immediately takes over.

---

## 5. Characteristics of a Fault-Tolerant System

A fault-tolerant system has **four basic characteristics**:

### 1. No Single Point of Failure (SPOF)

- No single component failure should bring down the entire system

Identifying SPOFs helps:
- Find critical components
- Prevent total system failure

---

### Preventing Single Point of Failure
