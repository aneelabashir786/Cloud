# Utility Computing – SOA, Web Services, QoS & SLA
---

## 1. What Is a Service?

A **service** is a piece of functionality that can be used by other systems over a network.

### Key Points
- A service is what you connect together using **Web Services**
- A service is the **endpoint** of a connection
- Each service performs a **specific task**

### Functionalities of a Service
A good service should be:

- **Well-defined**  
  → It clearly describes what it does
- **Self-contained**  
  → It can work independently
- **Independent of other services**  
  → It does not depend on the state or context of other services

 **Example:**  
A weather service that takes a city name and returns temperature.

## 2. What Is a Web Service?

A **web service** is a service that is available over the internet and can be accessed by other applications.

### Definition
- Web services are **self-describing**
- They are **stateless** (do not remember previous requests)
- They perform **small, discrete units of work**
- They are accessible over a **network**

### Web Service Providers
- Providers offer **APIs**
- Developers use these APIs to access functionality
- No need to install full applications

 **Example:**  
Google Maps API, Payment Gateway API, Weather API

---

## 3. Web Services Description Language (WSDL)

**WSDL** describes how to use a web service.

### Key Features
- Written in **XML**
- Defines:
  - Data types
  - Messages
  - Communication rules

### Types of Operations

1. **One-way**  
   - Message is sent
   - No response required

2. **Request and Response**  
   - Request is sent
   - Response is received

3. **Solicit Response**  
   - Service requests a response from the client

4. **Notification**  
   - Message sent to multiple receivers

---

## 4. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)

### Definition
**Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)** is a system design where multiple services communicate with each other.

### Characteristics
- Collection of independent services
- Services communicate over a network
- Loosely coupled architecture
- Services can be reused across different systems

### Purpose of SOA
- Flexibility
- Easy integration
- Reusability
- Scalability

 **Example:**  
An online shopping system:
- Login service
- Payment service
- Order service
- Delivery service

### Implementation
- Usually implemented using the **Web Service model**

---

## 5. Quality of Service (QoS)

### Original Definition
Quality of Service (QoS) refers to technologies used to manage network traffic efficiently to improve user experience.

### Modern Usage
QoS is now a broader term used for:
- Customer care evaluations
- Technological evaluations

---

## 6. QoS in Customer Care Evaluations

- Focuses on **customer experience**
- Measured by issues that negatively affect users
- Only problems affecting service quality are evaluated

### Examples
- Service downtime
- Slow response
- Failed transactions

---

## 7. QoS in Technological Evaluations

- Focuses on **system efficiency**
- Ensures optimal use of resources
- May involve:
  - Improving software
  - Adjusting procedures
  - Optimizing code

---

## 8. Service Level Agreement (SLA)

### Definition
A **Service Level Agreement (SLA)** is a formal contract between a service provider and a customer.

- Defines services in **measurable terms**
- Uses **QoS metrics**

### Common Contents of an SLA

#### Performance Metrics
- Up-time and down-time ratio
- System throughput
- Response time

#### Problem Management
- Issue reporting process
- Resolution time

#### Penalties
- Compensation for service failure

#### Security
- Documented security measures
- Data protection policies

 **Example:**  
If a cloud service does not meet the agreed uptime, penalties are applied.
